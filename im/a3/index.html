        <p id="explanationText"> Clicking the button below will cause the text on this site to grow infinitely. A button labeled 'shrink' will apear which will
            temporarily reset the text size when clicked and also move around the page randomly. There is also a random chance that the button will not 
            work when clicked, that the button will shrink when clicked, or even something else :)

            Feel free to read the text below and when you are ready to play the game, click the button below.

        <p id="growid"> When I chose to combine the abstract adjective of growing with the interaction design principle of feedback, I had a clear idea in mind of creating an event which caused something to grow once clicked. This shows a clear connection between the ideas of growing and feedback as well as highlighting how important it is to get feedback done correctly. If feedback is not envious enough to the user, then it can sometimes be unclear that something will happen when say a button is clicked and also if the outcome of said button is too subtle, then that too can be an issue for a userâ€™s navigation on a site. On the other hand, feedback can be overwhelming to a user, creating something which is too disrupting to the use of a site and can lead to the site being too inaccessible, quite contrary to the main point of feedback in the first place.

          To highlight how important it is to get this balance right, I decided to create a site which highlights how a user can be overwhelmed or confused when this balance is tipped too heavily one way or another. My idea was to create a site where the text grows infinitely and the user is required to press a button to reset the text size and make it more readable. This idea of the text growing after the button is clicked demonstrates a clear connection of the two prompts I chose being growth and feedback as well as showing what can happen when feedback is done incorrectly. The idea of having the text grow too big shows an example of what happens when the feedback is too overwhelming or disruptive and creates a very inaccessible site. On the other hand, I needed to demonstrate how feedback can be too understated so I created events where a button users click randomly does something which would be unexpected such as shrinking itself or simply not doing anything, rather than resetting the text size. 
          <br>
          <br>
          To create this site, I used a combination of html, css and javascript with most of the interactive design being done by the javascript. Using multiple functions as well as random number generation, when a button is clicked, the site will do something which the user does not have 100% control over being a selection of reducing the text size by altering the font-size, shrinking the button in a similar way, doing nothing and also increasing the title size. As well as this, the button also moves around the page randomly using a random position function which adds another degree of interactivity and also increases the inaccessibility of the site. I also added styling to the site to make it easy for users to navigate and read the site as I thought it would be too much to make this section of the site also inaccessible, rather creating a sense of unity through the font and creating a simple background colour and font colour.
          <br>
          <br>
          For the most part, the creation of my site went smoothly, but there was an issue regarding the animation of reducing the text size. I ran into an issue which I believe is related to the limits which javascript has with transitions. The issue is that the transition for reducing the text size stops playing after some time on the site which I was unable to fix. If i was to recreate the site, I would opt to change the font size in another way rather than using font-size changes and transitions times.
