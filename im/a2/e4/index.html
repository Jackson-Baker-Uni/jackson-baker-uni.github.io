        BUTTON AND ELEMENT ORDERING  
        above you can see some aditional buttons in the code as well as a change in order for these elements. Firstly we have the elements in the order of play button,
        mute button, video progress bar and finally the fullscreen. I chose to order these as such to best mimic standard placement for these icons on sites such as youtube
        vinemo and other streaming services. to change the odering i simply moved each element below or above eachother in the order i wanted them to apear from left to right.
      
        WHY I CHOSE FULLSCREEN
        I chose to add the fullscreen button as my additionall function as I believe it is an important fuction to have in a video player. the most important features to me
        are the ability pause, play mute and unmute as well as seeking in the video and fullscreen. since these were already implimented, I chose to add fullscreen as it was
        the last function i believe was essential. following this i beileve that the abilty to skip forward and backward are also important but this can also be done by
        seeking in the timeline, where as there is not a way to make the video fullscreen without this function.-->
