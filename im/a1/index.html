                What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
                <p> The first thing that caught my eye once opening the website is a loading screen which says "It's now safe to turn off your computer." This sets up the premise of the website being a play on older websites from the late 90's and early 2000's. It creates a overall both nostalgic yet comedic tone which is continued in the main website with the countless pop ups, old style text boxes and grey/blue colour palate of the boarders. </p>

                Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
                <p> 
                    Clicking buttons to close pop-ups.
                    <br>
                    Being redirected to otherwebsites with mini experiences such; screaming into the void, and reading an unagreeable User License Agreement.
                    <br>
                    Clicking cookies.
                    <br>
                    Clicking the 'Cybermonkey' which plays very loud muisc and monkey sound effects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What part of the experince did you spend the most time engaging with?
                <p> The part if spent the most time interactive with as the pop-up windows which do not allow you to close them, but rather agree to whatever they are saying. The often redirect you somewhere else or lead to a comedic interaction on the main site. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What was the most common action in your two minute interaction wit the experience?
                <p> Other than turning down my volume because the sound effects were too loud, the most common action with the website was again clicking and navigating the pop-ups and external sites which moved around the screen. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experince?
                <p> My impression of the intended primary goal is that the creator was intending to create a mock website in the style of late 90's/early 2000's websites about the end of the world, which pulls at nostalgic strings for people who used the internet back during that time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
                <p> The experince communicates this through the very bold and dated design of the website graphics, from the background, boarders, font choice, pop-up windows and sound effects which are often too loud or distorted, simillar to how sound effects could be on older websites.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is your impression of how the experience should be interactive with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
                <p> From my experience with the website, I believe it should be interacted with once but for around 15 minutes so that users have time to explore the website and see how many hidden jokes, redirects and pop-up windows they can discover. The site is intended to be enjoyed from a comedic point of view so using the site multiple times would loose its comedic value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
                <p> The website is very good at drawing users in with a very simple premise of clicking windows and exploring for hidden details. It's exciting to find a redirect to antoher site and the hiddle jokes such as the 'Cybermonkey' are interesting in the own merit.</p>
