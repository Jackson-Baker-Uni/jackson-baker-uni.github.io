            1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> The first thing that caught my eye once opening the website is a loading screen which says "It's now safe to turn off your computer." This sets up the premise of the website being a play on older websites from the late 90's and early 2000's. It creates an overall both nostalgic yet comedic tone which is continued in the main website with the countless pop ups, old style text boxes and grey/blue colour palette of the borders. </p> 
            </ol>
            <ol>
            2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> 
                    - Clicking buttons to close pop-ups.
                    <br>
                    - Navigating through the endless pop-ups which move around the screen.
                    <br>
                    - Being redirected to other websites with mini experiences such; screaming into the void, and reading an unagreeable User Licence Agreement.
                    <br>
                    - Clicking cookies.
                    <br>
                    - Clicking the 'Cybermonkey' which plays very loud music and monkey sound effects but also kills the monkey :(.
                    <br>
                    - Turning down the volume because the sound effects are too loud.
                    <br>
                    - Exploring a windows style interface with many games, interesting side sites to explore and other time wasters such as videos to watch.
                    <br>
                    - Attempting to unlock the other games with no luck.
                    <br>
                    - Spending too much time watching the restaurant fight video.
                    <br>
                    - Trying to build the skeleton (I couldn't quite figure it out).
                </p>
            </ol>
            <ol class="ol1">
            3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> While I did spend too much time watching the restaurant fight, the part I spent the most time interactive with was the pop-up windows along with the external links which redirect you somewhere else or lead to a comedic interaction on the main site.</p>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction wit the experience? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> Other than turning down my volume because the sound effects were too loud, the most common action was clicking around not only the intial 'Cybermonkey' site but also desktop section, attempting to see how many references and hidden details I could. </p>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> My impression of the intended primary goal is that the creator was intending to create a mock website in the style of late 90's/early 2000's websites about the end of the world, which pulls at nostalgic strings for people who used the internet back during that time. The secondary section of the virtual desktop also leaned into the style of late 90's and early 2000's computers and internet with many websites being very personalised and over the top with their theming and content which in turn, pulls on the nostalgic strings which this references. One specific thing which specifically reminds me of early 90's and 2000's internet specifically is the site where you can get extra wallpapers which load at and extremely slow speed.</p>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> The experience communicates this through the very bold and dated design of the website graphics, from the background, boarders, font choice, the classic windows desktop recreation, pop-up windows and sound effects which are often too loud or distorted, similar to how sound effects could be on older websites and in older version of windows (I'm looking at you old windows error sound).</p>
            </ol>
            <ol class="ol1">
            7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interactive with over time? (For how long and how many different times) <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> From my experience with the website, I believe it should be interacted with once but for around 15 minutes so that users have time to explore the website and see how many hidden jokes, redirects, secrets found in the virtual desktop, ways to unlock the hidden games and pop-up windows they can discover. The site is intended to be enjoyed from a comedic point of view so using the site multiple times would lose its comedic value.</p>
            </ol>
            <ol class="ol1">
            8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> The website is very good at drawing users in with a very simple premise of clicking on windows and exploring for hidden details in the virtual desktop. It's exciting to find a redirect to another site and the hidden jokes such as the 'Cybermonkey' or the switch to turn off the desktop are interesting in the own merit.</p>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> This website references many other forms of media, from older computers and software such as windows vista or windows xp, point and click games such as Hypnospace Outlaw, a classic idle game of cookie clicker and other forms of media such as planet of the apes with the 'Cybermonkey'. Other references include the sound effects, from the old Windows error sound, to the sound when getting redirected being a pitch altered version of the Batman sound effect from the old shows (The Bap, Zowie E-yow and Biff's were a nice touch too). </p>
            </ol>
            <ol class="ol1">
            10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> These references suggest that users should take their time when engaging with this website. Taking time when exploring and interacting with this website allows for more in depth exploration of the website which in turn, leads to more interesting discoveries, references and overall more enjoyment with this experience. </p>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> These references suggest and also make you feel entertained while engaging with the website. These references are comedic in their design and implementation which supports the suggested emotion of the website. The comedic pop-ups and premise of exploring a computer after the 'Cybermonkey' has blown up is very enjoyable and really reminds me of playing Hypnospace Outlaw, especially with the game websites. </p> 
            </ol>
            <ol>    
            12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> The most frustrating section of the website is a by-product of my favourite aspect of the website being constantly redirected. While funny and also leads to interesting websites, constantly being redirected loses its comedic value after a while and having to constantly close extra web pages is annoying after a while. </p>
            </ol>
            <ol class="ol1">
            13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying? <img src="./images/cross.png" width="25" class="pic_pos">
                <p> Oddly enough, the most satisfying element of the interaction was clicking the cookies at the bottom of the screen. Being a very obvious reference to cookie clicker, this element of the site acted as not only a neat reference (one I really enjoyed after spending many hours playing the game), but a satisfying distraction from the way the cookies moved around the screen, to the sound they made once clicked. If only there was a counter to see how many cookies I clicked. </p>
            </ol>
