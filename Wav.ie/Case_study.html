The wav.ie exhibit allowed us to research how people interact with intersensory translations. We have collated this research into a case study which is available to download and read using the link below.
<br>
<br>
In summary, we found that most visitors prefered more literal/objective translations over poetic/subject translations. However, this preference was not reflected in the types of translations that vistors left, instead most visitors wrote poetic/subjective translations.
